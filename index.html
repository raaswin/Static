<p>After Hanna and Barbera left MGM, the series was revived several times, most notably in the mid-1960s under the direction of famed animator <b>Chuck Jones.</b> These later versions changed certain elements of the series and softened the violence. The shorts became popular on television, and Hanna and Barberaâ€™s own company acquired the rights to create new Tom and Jerry episodes specifically for the small screen, producing 48 stories between 1975 and 1977. The show remained a television staple for decades, although racist or other offensive elements from the early features were usually edited.</p>
